# ROBO CAT
## Description  
Robocat is a game made in the Unity game engine for the GoNetPlay monthly game jame from May 12th, 2019 to May 17th, 2019. Sadly, it wasn't completed in time but I still wanted to share it. Technically, it is not up to the specs for the game jam either as it would still need multiplayer (maybe I'll come back to that)
## Controls
The controls are simple, use w, a, s, and d to move around and the mouse to look around. When near an object, click on it to destroy it.  
## Story
You play as RoboCat® V1. RoboCat® was created by RC Industries who created the robot to be a household friend without any of those pesky allergies. It was quickly found out, however, that RoboCats® were incredibly effective in warfare. 
RC Industries quickly capitilized on this by creating RoboCat® V2. This model was bigger, it was faster, and it was better than RoboCat® V1. Or at least that's what the marketing material said. What those head honchos forgot was that 
they kept the very first RoboCat® V1 around the office for company. Well, let's just say that it's not happy about the new model. Not one bit. So it's decided to show those pesky humans a piece of its CPU by wrecking 
their conference room after their celebratory launch party for the V2. There's only one issue, there's only 60 seconds of power before RoboCat® needs recharge...  
  
  
  
  
<sub> I feel like I have to put this so I don't somehow get into a legal bind, the ® symbol after RoboCat is purely for story telling purposes and I do not actually own a copyright to it...
