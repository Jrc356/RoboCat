# ROBO CAT
## Description  
Robocat is a game made in the Unity game engine for the GoNetPlay monthly game jame from May 12th, 2019 to May 17th, 2019. Sadly, it wasn't completed in time but I still wanted to share it. Technically, it is not up to the specs for the game jam either as it would still need multiplayer (maybe I'll come back to that)
## Controls
The controls are simple, use w, a, s, and d to move around and the mouse to look around. When near an object, click on it to destroy it.  
## Story
You play as Robocat V1. Robocat was created by RC Industries who created the robot to be a household friend without any of those pesky allergies. It was quickly found out, however, that Robocats were incredibly effective in warfare. 
RC Industries quickly capitilized on this by creating RoboCat V2. This model was bigger, it was faster, and it was better than Robocat V1. Or at least that's what the marketing material said. What those head honchos forgot was that 
they kept the very first Robocat V1 around the office for company. Well, let's just say that it's not happy about the new model. Not one bit. So it's decided to show those pesky humans a piece of its CPU by wrecking 
their conference room after their celebratory launch party for the V2.
